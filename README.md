Develop a Weather App with a 3-Tier Architecture
Objective: Develop a weather application that takes a city as input and displays the weather, utilising a 3-tier web application architecture. The project should showcase your proficiency in Docker, Kubernetes, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
Requirements:
Frontend:
A user interface for inputting a city and viewing the weather data.
Tech Stack: React
Backend:
A RESTful API to fetch weather data based on the city input.
Tech Stack: Node.js (optional)
Database:
Store any necessary data (if applicable).
Tech Stack: MongoDB (optional)
Infrastructure:
Containerize the application using Docker.
Deploy the application using Kubernetes, leveraging any preferred IaC tools.
Set up a 3-tier architecture with distinct pods for the frontend, backend, and database.
You may deploy on any platform of your choice (e.g., AWS, GCP, or a local Kubernetes cluster).
Nice to Have: Deploy infrastructure using Terraform.
